# Single-Axis-Solar-Tracker-Using-Linear-Actuator
Arduino and LDR sensors used to track sun from east to west by extending a linear actuator. Premiss: timed incremental extension of actuator to advance solar panels from east to west, then using LDR sensors to trim position further west if required.
